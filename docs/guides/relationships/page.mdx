# Relationships

Your data naturally has connections to one another. Students have
teachers, offices have employees, etc. Relationships are what
give a _relational_ database like Postgres its name.

Iceaxe has support for relationships via foreign keys. Let's take
the case of wanting to assign each Employee to an Office of record. We
define two separate tables for each objects, and specify that the object_id
key of Employees should link back to the office. This is a one-to-many relationship
since one office can have many employees.

```python
from iceaxe import TableBase, Field

class Office(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str

class Employee(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str
    office_id: int = Field(foreign_key="office.id")
```

When new data is inserted into the database, Postgres will validate that
the office_id that you've provided does in fact exist in the database. If not,
our underlying connection will raise an error.

```python
office = Office(name="HQ")
await conn.insert([office])

valid_employee = Employee(name="Alice", office_id=office.id)
invalid_employee = Employee(name="Bob", office_id=11111111)

await conn.insert([valid_employee]) # Works
await conn.insert([invalid_employee]) # Raises an error
```

How do we retrieve the office that an employee is associated with? We can
use the `join` method to specify that we want to pull in the office data. This
executes one efficient SQL query to get both objects. The resulting objects
in Python are typehinted as you expect.

```python
from iceaxe import select

query = select((Employee, Office)).join(
    Office,
    Employee.office_id == Office.id,
).where(
    Employee.name == "Alice",
)
results = await conn.exec(query)

alice, office = results[0]
print(f"{alice.name} (office.name)") # Alice (HQ)
```

## Many-to-many relationships

Many-to-many relationships are a bit more complex. Let's say we have a
many-to-many relationship between `Person` and `FavoriteColor`. A person
can have many favorite colors, and a color can be a favorite of many people.

This calls for a third table, `PersonFavoriteColor`, that links the two
tables together. It acts as the primary lookup table for the relationship. In theory
this relationship table can have additional fields - there's nothing unique
to it being a many-to-many relationship - but in this case we'll keep it simple.

```python
from iceaxe import TableBase, Field

class Person(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str

class FavoriteColor(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    color: str

class PersonFavoriteColor(TableBase):
    person_id: int = Field(foreign_key="person.id", primary_key=True)
    color_id: int = Field(foreign_key="favorite_color.id", primary_key=True)
```

To query the favorite colors of a person, we can use the `join` method like
before. Except instead of a direct equality comparison between the two
tables we'll want to use the bridge table as the central point of the join.

```python
query = select((Person, FavoriteColor)).join(
    PersonFavoriteColor,
    Person.id == PersonFavoriteColor.person_id,
).join(
    FavoriteColor,
    PersonFavoriteColor.color_id == FavoriteColor.id,
).where(
    Person.name == "Alice",
)
```

This is a more complicated query than before, so let's consider the actual
SQL that's being run:

```sql
SELECT person.*, favorite_color.*
FROM person
JOIN person_favorite_color ON person.id = person_favorite_color.person_id
JOIN favorite_color ON person_favorite_color.color_id = favorite_color.id
WHERE person.name = 'Alice'
```

A plain `JOIN` like this is the same as specifying an `INNER JOIN`. Since SQL
fetches results in a row based format, we'll receive |Person|*|Color| rows here. In
other words, if Alice has 3 favorite colors, we'll get 3 rows back alongside
3 copies of Alice's data. When cast into Python objects, we'll get get the same:

```python
[
    (Person(name="Alice"), FavoriteColor(color="Red")),
    (Person(name="Alice"), FavoriteColor(color="Green")),
    (Person(name="Alice"), FavoriteColor(color="Blue")),
]
```

Sometimes, that's okay if you're fetching a small amount of data. You can always
just group by the person to get a more compact result:

```python
from itertools import groupby

results = await conn.exec(query)
grouped = groupby(sorted(results, key=lamda x: x.id), lambda x: x.id)
for person_id, person_colors in grouped:
    person, colors = person_colors[0]
    print(f"{person.name} likes {', '.join(color.color for person, color in person_colors)}")
```

Alternatively, you can separate out your queries: one query to fetch the people
and one query to fetch the colors for all matching IDs:

```python
query = select(Person).where(Person.name == "Alice")
people = await conn.exec(query)

query = select((PersonFavoriteColor.person_id, FavoriteColor)).join(
    PersonFavoriteColor,
    FavoriteColor.id == PersonFavoriteColor.color_id,
).where(
    PersonFavoriteColor.person_id.in_([person.id for person in people]),
)
```

## Comparison with other ORMs

In some other ORMs that you might have used, there is an explicit
notion of defining and accessing child models right from the parent object. The
syntax might be something like:

```python
class Parent(Base):
    children = relationship("Child")

class Child(Base):
    parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("parent.id"))
    parent = relationship("Parent")
```

When you access `parent.children`, these ORMs will automatically issue
a new request to the database to pull the dependent children. Internally
this usually translates to the following SQL:

```python
# SELECT * FROM parent WHERE id = ?
parent_obj = db_session.get(Parent, parent_id)

# SELECT * FROM child WHERE parent_id = ?
for child in parent_obj.children:
    print(child)
```

This works naturally in syncronous code but isn't as straightforward
in async logic. When should the async ORM issue the request to fetch the
children? Should it be done when the parent object is created? When the
`children` attribute is accessed? If so, children would need to switch
to an awaitable type. Will the transaction be held for the duration of
both fetches? There are typically a host of options that govern each
ORM's behavior.

Plus, if you're dealing with multiple parent objects, it's common
to unintentionally issue a large number of queries to the database
when you iterate over the parent objects. This is known as the N+1
query problem.

Inline with Iceaxe's philosophy that SQL queries are better explicit
than implicit, we don't support this implicit relationship syntax. Instead
we support foreign keys and joins directly in the query. If you want to
implement something similar at the class level, it's pretty easy to do so:

```python
from iceaxe import TableBase, Field, select

class Parent(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str

    async def children(self, conn: DBConnection):
        query = select(Child).where(Child.parent_id == self.id)
        return await conn.exec(query)
```

But buyer beware: this will issue a new query to the database every time. Think about
if this is really the right approach for your use case. Normally it's better
to default to explicit joins in your queries.
