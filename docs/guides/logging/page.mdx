# Logging

At a standard logging level, Iceaxe is conservative with what it logs.

During development it's often useful to increase this verbosity to help diagnose the
SQL queries that are actually sent to your database. You can set the `ICEAXE_LOG_LEVEL` environment
variable to `DEBUG` to enable verbose logging:

```bash
ICEAXE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG poetry run runserver
```

This results in a lot of output, so you may want to pipe it to a file:

```bash
ICEAXE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG poetry run runserver > debug.log
```

Each entry in the log will be a JSON formatted, single-lined
payload with the timestamp and the logged sql message (or whatever other
message is logged by the iceaxe library). These JSON logs allow for
easier machine parsing and analysis of query performance.

```bash
{"level": "DEBUG", "name": "iceaxe", "timestamp": "2021-10-14 15:00:00,000", "message": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1"}
```
