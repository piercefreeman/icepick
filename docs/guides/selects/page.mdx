# Selects

`SELECT` statements are likely the most common operation you'll perform with Iceaxe. They're used to fetch
data from the database and receive them in Python instances or primitives. Let's
consider the following table definition to show how we can interact with
different types of data:

```python
from iceaxe import DBConnection, select, TableBase, Field

class Employee(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str
    age: int
```

Let's start off with the following users in the database:

| id | name              | age |
|----|-------------------|-----|
| 1  | Marcus Holloway   | 28  |
| 2  | Astrid Keller     | 42  |
| 3  | Jasper Okafor     | 36  |

If we want to get an exact match for a single row, we can use the `select` function
with an exact match filter for Marcus. You'd write this in the same way that you would check
for equality in a Python if statement.

```python
query = select(Employee).where(Employee.name == "Marcus Holloway")
```

All defined class attributes in the `Employee` class are available as columns, and these
columns can be used in equality operations like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, etc. If we
want, we can also preview the SQL and variables that are outputted for this query:

```python
query.build()
> ('SELECT "employee".* FROM "employee" WHERE "employee"."name" = $1', ['Marcus Holloway'])
```

As you see from the build output from `query.build()`, we're constructing a SQL with a single
WHERE filter that requests matches to `$1`. This is a placeholder for the actual value
that is passed to the database engine separately. The database engine handles the escaping
of any special values in this variable to avoid SQL injection attacks. Let's go ahead and execute
this query against the database to get the actual values back:

```python
results = await conn.exec(query)
results
> [Employee(id=1, name='Marcus Holloway', age=28)]
```

This will return a list of `Employee` instances that match the query. These instances
are full Python objects; you can access and modify their attributes as you would with any
other object. Once received, it's detached from the database connection unless you explicitly
choose to save it. For more details on how to update data, see the page on [update statements](./inserts).

## Chaining conditions

By default, conditions are combined with an `AND` operator. If you want to combine conditions with an `OR`
operator, you can use the `or_` function. For example, if you want to get all employees that are either 28 or 36 years old:

```python
from iceaxe import and_, or_

query = select(Employee).where(or_(Employee.age == 28, Employee.age == 36))

query.build()
> ('SELECT "employee".* FROM "employee"
    WHERE ("employee"."age" = $1 OR "employee"."age" = $2)', [28, 36])
```

These operations nest within themselves to create more complicated selection chains.
Let's extend the filter above to also get anyone who's named Marcus Holloway
or Astrid Keller. We expect to only receive one result.

```python
query = select(Employee).where(
    and_(
        or_(
            Employee.age == 28, Employee.age == 36,
        ),
        or_(
            Employee.name == "Marcus Holloway", Employee.name == "Astrid Keller"
        )
    )
)

query.build()
> ('SELECT "employee".* FROM "employee"
    WHERE (
        ("employee"."age" = $1 OR "employee"."age" = $2)
        AND
        ("employee"."name" = $3 OR "employee"."name" = $4)
    )',
    [28, 36, 'Marcus Holloway', 'Astrid Keller'])
```

Note that the outside `and_` is optional in this case since where will take care
of that for you. Still, it can sometimes make your code a bit more readable to include it
for more complicated query chains.

## Limit columns

In the above queries, we returned a full instance. For small queries the bandwidth of fetching an entire
object is usually negligible compared to the convenience of having a full object that you can work with
in other places in your pipeline. It's easier to track down references to `Employee` versus scattered strings
that correspond to their name. Still - for larger queries or larger tables, there are times when it's way
more efficient to only fetch the columns that you need. You can do this by specifying the columns you want
within the initial selection:

```python
query = select((Employee.id, Employee.name)).where(Employee.name == "Marcus Holloway")

query.build()
> ('SELECT "employee"."id", "employee"."name" FROM "employee"
    WHERE "employee"."name" = $1', ['Marcus Holloway'])
```

Unlike before when we passed a regular `Employee` class to the `select` function, we're now passing a tuple
of the different columns that we want to fetch. For any selection of more than one object, you'll need
to pass a tuple.

## Filter lists

Exact equality or boolean operations are not the only way to filter data. You can also use
some extensions to filter data in a more complex way. For example, let's say that we
want to get all employees that are either 28 or 36 years old. We _could_ make two separate
equality filters like the example above. But it's often easier to use the `in_` function to
filter data based on a list of values:

```python
from iceaxe import column

query = select(Employee).where(column(Employee.age).in_([28, 36]))

query.build()
> ('SELECT "employee".* FROM "employee" WHERE "employee"."age" = ANY($1)', [[28, 36]])
```

This will work at runtime with or without the call to `column`. But if you use static analysis like mypy
or pyright to validate your code, you'll need to use the `column` typecast to avoid type errors. Why?
In Iceaxe, the type of the column mirrors the type of the instance attribute. For the purposes of static analysis,
`Employee.age` here validates to an integer. And the integer primitive in Python doesn't have a method called
`in_`. By using the `column` typecast, you're explicitly telling the static analysis tool that you're
working with a column object that supports this method accessor.

## Aggregation queries

Aggregation queries allow you to perform calculations on groups of rows
in your database. Iceaxe provides a simple way to construct these queries
using the `group_by` method and aggregation functions. To make things more
interesting, let's add a bit more data with some overlapping values:


| id | name              | age |
|----|-------------------|-----|
| 1  | Marcus Holloway   | 28  |
| 2  | Astrid Keller     | 42  |
| 3  | Jasper Okafor     | 36  |
| 4  | Kaitlyn Winters   | 36  |
| 5  | Merilyn Keller    | 36  |

Let's get the average age of all employees:

```python
from iceaxe import func

query = select(func.avg(Employee.age))

query.build()
> ('SELECT avg("employee"."age") AS aggregate_0 FROM "employee"', [])

await conn.exec(query)
> [35.6]
```

Grouping rows and then executing these functions is even more powerful, because
you can perform different rollups. A simple one to find the amount of employees by age.

```python
query = select(
  (func.count(Employee.id), Employee.age),
).group_by(Employee.age)

query.build()
> ('SELECT count("employee"."id") AS aggregate_0, "employee"."age" FROM "employee" GROUP BY "employee"."age"', [])

await conn.exec(query)
> [(1, 28), (3, 36), (1, 42)]
```

## Raw SQL

<Note>
Iceaxe has the philosophy that any queries constructed by the ORM
should work efficiently and be typehinted correctly. If we can't typehint it correctly, we
won't offer it within the Python layer. For these cases - and more complex queries in general -
read this section to learn how to manually cast queries.
</Note>

If you're working on a more complex, and still want to receive the results as
Iceaxe typed objects, you can do a manual casting of the results. Using the `text()`
method of a selection query will override any other dynamic query building and
just pass your SQL directly to the database engine.

```python
from iceaxe import sql

query = select(Employee).text(
    f"""
    SELECT {sql.select(Employee)} FROM employee
    WHERE {sql(Employee.age)} = $1
    """,
    28
)
query.build()
> 'SELECT "employee"."id" AS "employee_id", "employee"."name" AS "employee_name", "employee"."age" AS "employee_age"
> FROM employee
> WHERE "employee"."age" = $1'
>, [28]
```

The `sql` class is a utility class that allows you to cast Table definitions to a SQL fstring. This gives you
the ability to use the same Table definitions in your SQL as you do in your Python code, alongside basic typehinting
of table columns. If you change column names, your linter should detect the conflict in this SQL as well.

There are a few different sql methods depending on where you're inserting them in your SQL.

| Method | Input | Output | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `sql.select(Table)` | `User` | `"users"."id" AS "users_id", "users"."name" AS "users_name"` | Full table selection with aliased columns |
| `sql.select(Table.column)` | `User.name` | `"users"."name" AS "users_name"` | Single column selection with alias |
| `sql(Table)` | `User` | `"users"` | Qualified table name |
| `sql(Table.column)` | `User.name` | `"users"."name"` | Qualified column name |
| `sql.raw(Table)` | `User` | `"users"` | Raw table name |
| `sql.raw(Table.column)` | `User.name` | `"name"` | Raw column name |

Always use sql.select for select queries, since these will internally map to our ORM convention that's required to
cast the results to the correct Python object during postprocessing.

We will typecast the results as whatever you pass to the original `select` method, so make sure this value is always
kept in sync with what you query in your manual SQL text.

The `text` method accept a single string of a SQL operation, then as many variables as you pass
within the keyword arguments. These variables are accessible to your SQL string as one-indexed
variables that correspond to the order of arguments. These are formatted as `$1`, `$2`, etc. Variables
passed via Python variable will be encoded correctly to avoid SQL injection attacks so are recommended
for any user input.

```python
results = await conn.exec(query)
> [Employee(id=1, name='Marcus Holloway', age=28)]
```

If you have more complicated selection logic that doesn't directly reference table selections via `sql.select`,
we also support aliasing values to directly extract them from the query.

```python
from iceaxe import alias

query = select(alias(int, "age_int")).text(
    f"""
    SELECT COUNT(*) as age_int FROM employee 
    WHERE {sql(Employee.age)} = $1
    """,
    28
)
```
