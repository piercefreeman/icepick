# Migrations

Whether you're starting a new project or already have a table schema
in place, you're eventually going to modify your TableBase schema and
need that reflected in your database. Instead of writing this logic by
handle, we bundle a series of utilities that handle this manipulation
for you in a safe and predictable way.

You'll typically want to call your migration commands from your command line. So
we can go ahead and import your CLI library of choice and write some wrapper
code on top of our utility functions. We start by defining our project name (the
same one that's declared in your pyproject.toml file) alongside a helper function
to get a connection to your database.

For a real project, you'll want to grab these values from environment variables.

```python
# cli.py
import asyncio
import asyncpg
from click import command, option

from iceaxe import DBConnection
from iceaxe.migrations.cli import handle_generate, handle_apply, handle_rollback

from myproject import models # noqa: F401

PROJECT = "myproject"

async def get_connection():
    return DBConnection(
        await asyncpg.connect(
            host="localhost",
            port=5432,
            user="db_user",
            password="yoursecretpassword",
            database="your_db",
        )
    )
```

Now we can write the CLI functions that will actually be called. Iceaxe takes
care of the core logic, so our job here is just to expose it to the command line.

```python
@command()
@option("--message", help="A message to attach to the migration")
def generate(message: str | None):
    async def _inner():
        await handle_generate(PROJECT, await get_connection(), message=message)
    asyncio.run(_inner())

@command()
def apply():
    async def _inner():
        await handle_apply(PROJECT, await get_connection())
    asyncio.run(_inner())

@command()
def rollback():
    async def _inner():
        await handle_rollback(PROJECT, await get_connection())
    asyncio.run(_inner())
```

Great, now just modify your pyproject.toml file to make these callable. If you're
using Poetry, you can add the following to your `tool.poetry.scripts` section:

```toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
migrate-generate = "myproject.cli:generate"
migrate-apply = "myproject.cli:apply"
migrate-rollback = "myproject.cli:rollback"
```

## Generating migrations

Let's say we currently have a simple Employee table that's defined in our
database. It has an auto-incrementing ID and a name.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | int       | PRIMARY KEY |
| name        | varchar   |             |

We want to add an age to each user record, so we modify our TableBase schema
to include this new field.

```python
from iceaxe import TableBase, Field

class Employee(TableBase):
    id: int | None = Field(primary_key=True, default=None)
    name: str
    age: int  # new field
```

When we call our `migrate-generate` from the CLI, Iceaxe will do the following:

- Use the database connection to introspect the current schema
- Compare the current schema to the new schema, creating a migration pathway
  to convert one to the other
- Generate a migration file that will add the `age` column to the `employee` table

```bash
$ poetry run migrate-generate

Generating migration to current schema
New migration added: rev_1729278706.py
```

It places the following file in your `myprojects/migrations` directory:

```python
from iceaxe.migrations.migrator import Migrator
from iceaxe.migrations.migration import MigrationRevisionBase
from iceaxe.schemas.actions import ColumnType

class MigrationRevision(MigrationRevisionBase):
    """
    Migration auto-generated on 2024-10-18T12:11:46.941324.

    Context: None

    """
    up_revision: str = "1729278608"
    down_revision: str | None = None

    async def up(self, migrator: Migrator):
        await migrator.actor.add_column(table_name="employee", column_name="age", explicit_data_type=ColumnType.INTEGER, explicit_data_is_list=False, custom_data_type=None)
        await migrator.actor.add_not_null(table_name="employee", column_name="age")

    async def down(self, migrator: Migrator):
        await migrator.actor.drop_column(table_name="employee", column_name="age")
```

This file contains the logic to transform your current schema to the new schema (`up`) as well
as to undo those changes and revert back to the original schema (`down`). This down logic
lets you rollback changes that potentially break your application.

You can modify these migration functions to include additional logic, such as defaulting
default values for the new column or migrating data from one column to another. For this
`up` function we'd probably want to insert our known ages for our employees.

```python
async def up(self, migrator: Migrator):
    await migrator.actor.add_column(table_name="employee", column_name="age", explicit_data_type=ColumnType.INTEGER, explicit_data_is_list=False, custom_data_type=None)

    # Insert known ages for employees
    await migrator.db_connection.exec(
        ...
    )

    await migrator.actor.add_not_null(table_name="employee", column_name="age")
```

## Applying migrations

When you're happy with your migration, you can apply it to your database by running
the `migrate-apply` command. This migration will apply any unapplied migrations in
your migrations folder up to the last revision.

```bash
$ poetry run migrate-apply

🚀 Applied 1729278608 in 0.02s
```

## Undoing migrations

If you need to rollback a migration, you can run the `migrate-rollback` command. This
will undo 1 migration at a time, starting with the most recent migration.

```bash
$ poetry run migrate-rollback

🪃 Rolled back migration to None in 0.01s
```
